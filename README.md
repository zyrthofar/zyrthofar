**Zyrthofar** is my name. It means "the one upon whose shoulder the sun shines brightest" in proto-indo-european.

### Work

Working for [Kumojin](https://kumojin.com/), a Quebec-based company that specializes in being awesome, has saved my life three times in the past. I estimate that it will save it again about twelve more times in the future.

I am the maintainer of [Ravn](https://gitlab.com/ravnmsg/ravn), an open-source notification orchestrator with a staggering rating of **1** star(s)!

I desire to level-up in electronics, robotics, ECS, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and nuclear physics. Here's my [Patreon](https://example.com).
